# Exercise 5

In this exercise, you'll practice sending AJAX requests and displaying the results. You will do this to display music track listings from a web API (specifically, the [iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/)):

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`exercise.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments.

You can see the results of your work by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser; be sure to also check the [Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/). You also can run a local webserver:

```
cd /path/to/exercise
python -m http.server
```
